# VUT index scraper extension
- Chrome extension for scraping the electronic index from VUT STUDIS website. Returns pretty-formated data.

## How to use
1. Pack the extension as .crx file OR add it directly unpacked into Chrome.
2. You must be on the index site - don't worry, extension has ability to redirect you (but you will need to log in).
3. Scrape whatever you want! :-)

**ONLY FOR VUT STUDENTS**
